            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>OUR Author has foreſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his Reader with a long Preface, and Cuſtom has ſo obtain'd, that not to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it were to allow it for Truth; yet as long ſoever as it is, I may be the ſhorter in mine, in regard there are ſome things we ſhall not much differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: As when he begins <hi>to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant on the Misfortunes of a Perſon fallen from ſo high a Dignity, who has alſo paid his final Debt both to Nature and his Faults, is not of it ſelf a thing commendable:</hi> And I come ſo near him that I deem it in no wiſe commendable; much leſs to defend a Party, by whoſe Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
<pb facs="tcp:62942:3"/>he fell: For Revenge and Envy ſtop at the Grave; and however our Lives are at the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of others, even Fortune her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has no Dominion over the Dead. But when he ſays, <hi>And his Faults,</hi> and that <hi>it is not the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Diſcourſe,</hi> I referr my Reader to this of mine, wherein, from the Ordinances of that time, and the Law of the Land, I have (I hope) acquitted the King; and for the other, whatever his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might be, prov'd his Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he gives out here.</p>
            <p>He further <hi>ſuppoſes it no Injury to the Dead, but a good Deed rather to the Living, to better inform them by remembring them the Truth of what they themſelves know to be miſ-affirm'd.</hi> And I agree with him; for if a Man may not make the Blind to go out of his way, there is this Charity due to a Short-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb facs="tcp:62942:3"/>Multitude, to point them (at leaſt) where they firſt went aſtray, and by bringing them back to the old Paths, both ſhew them how they loſt their Way, and ſet them right for the future.</p>
            <p>Yet agree as we will we muſt part at laſt; for inſtead of not diſcanting on the Misfortunes of his murther'd Sovereign, and of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter informing the People of what (he ſlily inſinuates) themſelves know to be miſ-affirm'd by the King, the whole drift of his Book is to blaſt the one, and ſpread a Miſt before the other; whereas mine is to vindicate the King, and what in me lies to clear the Air of that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent Vapour. In the mean time, and until I come to it, I ſhall briefly conſider the matter of his Preface, and the manner of putting it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62942:4"/>
            <p> As to the former, it is an abſtract of his Book written in Scandal to the King's Book and himſelf; <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for their Sakes, who thro' Cuſtom, Simplicity, or want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Teaching have not more ſeriouſly conſider'd Kings than in the gaudy name of Majeſty, in behalf of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the Commonwealth.</hi> That is to ſay, Licentiouſneſs and <hi>Democracy,</hi> words altogether foreign to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whoſe Conſtitutions know nothing but an Hereditary, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Monarchy, recognizing no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour under God but only the King, unto whom both Spiritualty and Temporalty are bound and owe a Natural Obedience: Unto which his Notions are directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; for if the Soveraignty lay in the People the King were not Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, but himſelf ſubject to that Power which is tranſcendent to his, as appertaining to them; and then
<pb facs="tcp:62942:4"/>the State of <hi>England</hi> were <hi>Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical;</hi> if it lay in the Nobles then were it <hi>Ariſtocratical;</hi> or if in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or all of them it were in no wiſe <hi>Monarchical;</hi> which both the Common-Law and Statute-Law of <hi>England</hi> have ever declar'd this Kingdom to be, as ſhall be ſhewn in its proper place.</p>
            <p>And yet he doubts not to impoſe upon his Reader, That <hi>the People heretofore were wont to repute for Saints thoſe faithful and couragious Barons</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>who loſt their Lives in the Field, making glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious War againſt Tyrants for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Liberty; As</hi> Simon de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <hi>Earl of</hi> Leiceſter <hi>againſt</hi> Henry <hi>the Third;</hi> Thomas Plantagenet <hi>Earl of</hi> Lancaſter <hi>againſt</hi> Edward <hi>the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</hi> And truly—<hi>Siqua eſt ea Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. — England</hi> wants not wherein to Glory; though I think neither of theſe comes under his Character:
<pb facs="tcp:62942:5"/>For the firſt of them (a <hi>Frenchman</hi> by Extraction) ran into open Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, whoſe Siſter he had firſt vitiated, then Married: Took the King Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and carried him about in the Army (as <hi>Cromwell</hi> did this King) and made him own all his (the Earl's) Actions (as the Parliament, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually, endeavour'd it alſo) and was at laſt ſlain in actual Rebellion at the Battle of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> by the Prince (our <hi>Engliſh Juſtinian,</hi>) the Man, who by reſcuing oppreſs'd Laws, taught the Crown of <hi>England</hi> not to ſerve, and firſt deliver'd it from the Wardſhip of the Barons.</p>
            <p>Theſe Barons, the Deſcendants of thoſe, where the Devil in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turn'd Monk in the Son; for being conſcious to themſelves that whatever they had, whether of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Poſſeſſions had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd in Conqueſt and Rapine,
<pb facs="tcp:62942:5"/>what better way of ſecuring both than by ſiding with the People, who had by this time forgotten they were the Poſterity of thoſe who had beggar'd their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors.</p>
            <p>And for the other of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> he alſo was taken in a like Rebellion againſt <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, and being thereof Convicted, was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed at <hi>Pomfrect:</hi> nor other than Rebellion, do I find any Remark of him, but that his Name was <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenet,</hi> and the <hi>Mobb</hi> call'd him King <hi>Arthur.</hi> And therefore the moſt that can be ſaid of them is, (what <hi>Aaron</hi> of his Calf) <hi>Theſe be thy Gods O</hi> Iſrael!</p>
            <p>And having laid this Foundation for Matter, who could expect his manner of doing it ſhould be better, more than that <hi>Grapes may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of Thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles?</hi> Nor has he in the leaſt deceiv'd me
<pb facs="tcp:62942:6"/>in it; when though there's a decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Language due to the meaneſt of Men, and Mankind inſults not over a Slave in Miſery, yet neither in his Preface or his whole Book do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ctions without that irreverence as would put a modeſt Man to the Bluſh in reading it. What the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Expreſſions are I forbear to mention them where I may poſſibly avoid it, and referr the Reader to them as they every where occur, leſt otherwiſe I be like him that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to anſwer a Seditious Book, and Prints that with his anſwer, that it may be remembred <hi>cum Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However this from the whole; though the Scripture calls Princes Gods, that Prince is yet to be born whoſe ſome action or other did not confeſs Humanity, and require Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. <hi>Moſes</hi> was <hi>King among the
<pb facs="tcp:62942:6"/>Righteous,</hi> and David <hi>a Man after God's own Heart,</hi> and yet it cannot be ſaid of either of them, <hi>In nullo erratum eſt:</hi> And therefore inſtead of raking the Graves of Princes, we ſhould neither cenſure them rigidly, nor deny them the ſame mildneſs with which we commiſerate the Infirmities of other Men: Or at leaſt, if we muſt be prying and poring, be ſo juſt to our ſelves as not to publiſh the Miſcarriage and ſuppreſs the Vertue. In a word, let him that would make a true Judgment of this oppreſs'd King, firſt conſider his Circumſtances, and then tell me whether where he ſtretch'd his Authority he had not been firſt neceſſitated to it by thoſe that murther'd him; and whether the worſt of his Actions were not ſuperabundantly expiated with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good; which our <hi>Accuſer</hi> has ſo every where endeavour'd to ſilence,
<pb facs="tcp:62942:7"/>and ſupplied with Calumnies, that I'll cloſe all with that Abſtract of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Epiſtles: Xerxes<hi>'s Arrows may darken the Day, but they cannot ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62942:10"/>had otherwiſe miſs'd: However, whether it were that <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> or another of the ſame Name, in or near <hi>London</hi> (as Printers have a way to themſelves) it matters not, its Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are altogether Republican, and whoever he were that thus ſhuffled it into the World, took the right courſe, in chuſing darkneſs ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than light, becauſe his Way was evil. To have offered at a Commonwealth directly, had been Madneſs; and yet, who knew how he might turn it about by a Side Wind?</p>
               <p n="2">2. That a Book which from its firſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been Waſte-Paper, and never read (by any good Man) without Contempt, ſhould (after an interval of two and forty Years) be raked out of its forgotten Embers, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign at bottom had not been to re-mind the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the days of old, and hint to them, how the ſame Cards may be play'd over again, as God ſhall enable them, <hi>i. e.</hi> as opportunity ſhall offer. And, if this be not the drift of it, let any Man judge; when in beſpattering that good King, it repreſents to them, by a falſe Glaſs, what they may expect from other Kings; and, in effect tells them, A Lyon is ſtill a Lyon, and tho' his (laws be pared they'll grow agen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That (as if there had been ſome private agreement between them) it was ſeconded by another to the ſame Tune, intituled, <hi>A Letter from</hi> Major General Ludlow <hi>to Sir E. S.</hi> which whether it were his, or his Name only made uſe of to ſerve a turn, will not be much in the Caſe, tho' it confirm the Deſign. The name is yet a popular name among that Faction, and himſelf, a daring Man; witneſs his late regreſs into <hi>England,</hi> and that not <hi>Incognito,</hi> but in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62942:10"/>face of the Sun, in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Judges then ſitting, where once he ſate Judge himſelf; and had there been a third of Mr. <hi>Jenkins</hi>'s to have rung <hi>All-in,</hi> What wonder if the Sheep had followed their Bell-wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
               <p>And if this were not the Deſign, ſtrange it ſeems, and no ſmall breach of Politicks, to have thruſt it on the World, at a time when three of the Grand-Children of that King, are yet Living, and two of them in poſſeſſion of the Throne. It was one of <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Sarcaſms</hi> to <hi>Salmatius (Patrem defendis ad fillum, mirum ni cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam obtineas!)</hi> You defend the Father to the Son, no wonder if you carry the Cauſe! But on the other hand, how can any of His Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity think themſelves ſecure, while the murther of the Grandfather is yet mention'd without ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence? When (in a manner) it hints the Faction with the Proverb <hi>(Stultus qui, patre caeſo, pepercit liberis, tandem aliquando patriae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis futuros vindices:)</hi> He's a Fool that kills the Father, and ſpares the Children, who ſome time or other will be ſure to revenge it.</p>
               <p>But malicious, and nothing but malicious, could be the Printing <hi>the Advertiſement</hi> at the end of his Preface, grounded it ſeems upon a <hi>Memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Angleſey</hi>'s: Viz.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Theſe Meditations are written feelingly, and carry with them the Senſe and Language of a Perſon under ſuch Circumſtances. <hi>Jeremiah</hi> in his <hi>Prophecy</hi> denounceth Judgments to others, and ſpeaks with the Tongue of him that ſent him; but in his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> we ſee him in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62942:11"/>diſtreſs himſelf, and his Stile is as mournful, as the City he bewails. And he that reads <hi>Job</hi> with due conſideration (inſtead of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether he wrote it himſelf) cannot but ſit down and weep with him: Eſpecially, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this with it, that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (in his Pen) labours more to deſcribe that affliction, than ever it did the Felicities of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

Try him with a ridiculous Pageantry, that had neither Equal nor Superiour in his Realm: Traiterouſly ſentence him, and as ignominiouſly murther him before his own Palace: And (to fill up the meaſure of their Wickedneſs) aboliſh Kingly Government, and proſcribe his Poſterity.</p>

A Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite is the ſame to a King, that a Friend is to a Private Man, he may unburthen himſelf to him; and it is not the Crowd, but agreement makes the Company. Nor are all Men of like Merit, more than they are of Face; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a King ſay <hi>Euge bone Serve,</hi> muſt our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer's Eye be evil, becauſe the King's is good. But the point lies not there: They are not piqu'd that the King might have Favourites, but that themſelves are not thoſe Favourites and conſequently wanting Vertue in themſelves, not only envy it in others, but ſtrike at the Prince through the Sides of his Favourites.</p>
               <p>I thought to have paſs'd that, <hi>The King's Reverend Statute</hi> (as he calls it) <hi>for</hi> Dominical <hi>Jiggs and Maypoles, publiſh'd in his own Name, and deriv'd from the Example of his Father</hi> James: And had ſo done, but that it being ſpoken to the People upon the Wall, I alſo thought it could be no hurt to undeceive them in the matter. <hi>Statute</hi> I am ſure there is none in the caſe, and if there were, Where lies the Blame?

               </p>
               <p>And again (for he cannot ſpeak without bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs) where the King ſays, <q>I intended not only to oblige my Friends, but my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies alſo; exceeding even the deſires of thoſe that were Factiouſly diſcontented, if they did but pretend to any modeſt and ſober Senſe.</q> He ſays thus; <hi>Poets never put more pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words in the Mouth of any Perſon than of a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and I ſhall not inſtance an abſtruſe Author, wherein the King might be leſs converſant, but one whom we well knew was the Cloſet-Companion of theſe his Solitudes,</hi> William Shakeſpear, <hi>who

And the Act further ſays, It was procured by an armed Tumult, the names of Fifty nine of the Commons that oppoſed the Bill, poſted by the name of <hi>Straffordians;</hi> and ſent up to the Peers at a time when a great part of them were abſent by reaſon of thoſe Tumults, and many of thoſe preſent, proteſted againſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62942:25"/>it. For which Cauſes, and to the end that Right be done to the Memory of that deceaſed Earl, it was enacted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That the ſaid Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be repeal'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all. Records and proceedings of Parliament relating to the ſaid Attainder be cancell'd and taken off the File, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the intent the ſame may not be viſible in after-Ages, or brought in Example to the prejudice of any Perſon whatever.

               <p>It had been advis'd to the King by the then Privy-Council of <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſend the Book of Common-Prayer to be receiv'd and us'd in all Churches of that Kingdom,<note place="margin">The King's Declaration, <hi>1639.</hi>

The King came to the Houſe with an attendance ſhort of his ordinary Guard, and it was Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Breach of Privilege. They had their armed Tumults of Six Thouſand at a time to awe the King's Friends, and no notice taken of it, but rather encourag'd: Whereas it is <hi>Lex &amp; conſuetudo Parliamenti;</hi>

               <p>And for what His Majeſty's Intention in this matter was (beſides what has been before urg'd) take this further from himſelf, where he ſays <q>If he purpos'd any Violence or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion againſt the Innocent; then let the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy perſecute my Soul, tread my Life to the Ground, and lay my Honour in the Duſt.</q> To which this Accuſer thus: <hi>What needs there more diſputing?

               <p>WHat, and how frequent the Tumults of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> that follow'd the convening of this Parliament were, is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough to every Man that knows the leaſt of our own Story; and how aptly His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty has compar'd them, not to a Storm at Sea, (which yet wants not its Terror) <q>but an Earthquake, which ſhakes the very Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all, may be alſo as viſible from the too ſad effects of them.</q> Earthquakes, the more general they are do leſs hurt, by reaſon of the united weight which they offer to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert; whereas narrow and particular Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes have many times overturn'd whole Towns and Cities. And ſuch was the Caſe here. The Kingdom as yet ſtood well enough, witneſs thoſe the Nobility and Gentry, who out of a principle of Honour and Honeſty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the King: Some humours (tis true) might glow and eſtuate in the Body, but they were not yet got into the Head; (That Ricketty Head that was already ſwoll'n too big for the Body.) But when they once diſcover'd that Vent, all gather'd to it, and ſhook thoſe Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations which the Wiſdom of ſo many Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had been laying and ſecuring; as I ſhall come to ſhow preſently.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62942:29"/>
               <p> In the mean time our Anſwerer (for what concerns the King's Words) ſays, <hi>The matter here is not whether the King or his Houſhold</hi> Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torician <hi>have made a Pithy Declamation againſt Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, but firſt whether they were Tumults or not; next if they were, whether the King himſelf did not cauſe them;</hi> and having all along begg'd the Queſtion as to the firſt, makes the other as a conſequence of the former. <hi>The King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having both unwillingly call'd this Parliament, and as unwillingly from time to time condeſcended to their ſeveral Acts, firſt tempts the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Army with no leſs Reward than the Spoil of</hi> London, <hi>to come up and deſtroy the Parliament; But that being diſcover'd, makes the like bait to the</hi> Scotch <hi>Army, with the Addition of four</hi> Northern <hi>Counties to be made</hi> Scottiſh; <hi>with Jewels of great value to be given in Pawn the while, which they with much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty gave notice of to the Parliament. Beſides this, a malignant Party was grown up; The Rebellion of</hi> Ireland <hi>broke out; a Conſpiracy in</hi> Scotland <hi>had been made while the King was there againſt ſome Chief Members of that Parliament; numbers of unknown ſeditious Perſons reſorted to the City; the King upon his return from</hi> Scotland, <hi>diſmiſſes that Guard the Parliament thought neceſſary to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them,</hi> and appoints <hi>another, which they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; the People therefore, leſt their worthieſt and faithful Patriots ſhould want aid, came in Multitudes, tho' unarm'd, to witneſs their Fidelity to them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The King ſends a Meſſage into the City for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding ſuch Reſorts; the Parliament Petition the King for a Guard out of the City to be commanded by the Earl of</hi> Eſſex; <hi>the King refuſes it, and the next day comes to the Houſe of Commons, and begins to fortifie his Court; many are wounded,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62942:29"/>whereof ſome died;</hi> and ſo concludes <hi>it was no Tumult: Or if it grew to be ſo, the Cauſe was in the King himſelf, who both by hoſtile Preparations, and an actual aſſailing the People, gave them juſt cauſe to defend themſelves.</hi> Which (ſaving the ſcandal of his wording it) is the full ſubſtance of his 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th Pages. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in alſo how far he has begg'd the Queſtion, I appeal to every unbiaſs'd Reader.</p>
               <p>How willingly the King call'd this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>1</label> I have already ſhewn. And why he ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly paſs'd the Bill of Attainder againſt the willingly paſs'd the Bill of Attainder againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> I have not been wanting to it, and if he had never condeſcended to ſeveral of the Bills paſs'd this Parliament, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Chap. </seg>2</label> and ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd, he had not with one hand cut off the other. But when he calls them <hi>their Acts</hi> I am to ſeek what he means. The office of the two Houſes is Preparative and Conſultive, but the Character of the Power reſts in the final Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the King: The paſſing a Bill is but the granting a Requeſt; the two Houſes make the Bill, but the King makes the Law, and 'tis the Stamp, not the Matter that makes it currant.</p>
               <p>Then for that ridiculous Sham of <hi>the Spoil of the City of</hi> London, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He might as well have added the blowing up the <hi>Thames,</hi> and drowning the City, and altogether as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unleſs he had prov'd at leaſt ſomewhat to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.—The Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> ('tis true) was broke out, and they had gotten Four Hundred Thouſand Pounds towards the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it; but what they did with thoſe Moneys I have ſhewn before.

               <p>
                  <q>THIS my repulſe at <hi>Hull</hi> (ſaith the King) was the firſt <hi>overt Eſſay</hi> to be made, how patiently I could bear the loſs of my Kingdoms. — The hand of that Cloud which was ſoon after to over-ſpread the whole Kingdom, and caſt all into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and darkneſs.</q> Which, how Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically true it was, the miſerable effects of it both before and ſince the Reſtauration, have too viſibly ſpoken it. And yet our Anſwerer thus ſlubbers it over. That <hi>Hull, a Town of great Strength and Opportunity both to Sea and Land Affairs, was at that time the Magazine of all thoſe Arms which the King had bought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the</hi> Scots.—<hi>The King had left the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and was gone Northward. — The Queen into</hi> Holland, <hi>where ſhe pawn'd and ſet to Sale the Crown Jewels (a Crime heretofore counted Treaſonable in Kings) and to what purpoſe the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was not ignorant, and timely ſent Sir</hi> John Hotham, <hi>Knight of that County, to take</hi> Hull <hi>into his Cuſtody, and ſome of the</hi> Train'd-bands <hi>to his Aſſiſtance; and ſeeing the King's Drift in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Guard for his Perſon, ſend him a Petition that they might have leave to remove the Magazine of</hi> Hull <hi>to the Tower of</hi> London, <hi>which the King denies, and ſoon after goes to</hi> Hull <hi>with Four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62942:41"/>Horſe, and requires the Governour to deliver him up the Town; whereof the Governour prays to be excuſed till he could ſend notice to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament who had entruſted him; and the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incens'd at it, Proclaims him a Traytor before the Town Walls, and demands Juſtice of them, as upon a Traytor; who declare that Sir</hi> John Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham <hi>had done no more than his Duty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was no Traytor.</hi> And this is the Subſtance of his 57. 58. 59 Pages.</p>
               <p>How (and by their own Authority which was none) the Houſes had rais'd an Army and made <hi>Eſſex</hi> General, I have already ſhewn; and though the King had not yet ſet up his <hi>Standard,</hi> he knew he had a Magazine at <hi>Hull</hi> which might either help to defend himſelf, or certainly annoy him if it fell into his Enemies Hands; and therefore in order to a Self-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, takes a Journey to <hi>York,</hi> where the Parliament had been before him with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee then lying there as Spies upon his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: However, upon Petition of that County, to have the Magazine of <hi>Hull</hi> to remain there for the greater Security of the Northern Parts, His Majeſty thought fit to take it into his own Hands, and appointed the Earl (afterwards Duke) of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> to be Governour of <hi>Hull;</hi> but the Townſmen had been ſo influenc'd by that Committee that they refuſed the Earl.</p>
               <p>The Queen alſo had borrow'd ſome Moneys of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> upon the Crown Jewels (<hi>a Crime heretofore counted treaſonable in Kings,</hi> but not a word of when, or by what Law) not in the leaſt conſidering the Crown it ſelf was the King's, or how the King of <hi>England</hi> could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Treaſon againſt himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62942:42"/>
               <p> The Houſes during this time wanting no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from their Committee, nick the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and ſend down Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who was receiv'd as Governour, and upon the King's coming before <hi>Hull,</hi> attended only with his own Servants, and ſome Gentlemen of the Country, audaciouſly ſhut the Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Him, and ſtanding upon the Wall, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him Entrance.

               </p>
               <p>And <hi>will take no notice that thoſe about him were the beginners of thoſe Tumults.</hi> That the King had his Guards about him was no more than
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62942:44"/>what became the Majeſty of a King; and that the Loyal Gentry made their Appearances at <hi>Whitehall</hi> when they ſaw it beſet with a kind of <hi>Gebal</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> and <hi>Ameleck,</hi> a confus'd conflux of People, which alſo the King had forbidden, was but the leaſt of their Duty: But when he talks of liſting, and abuſing, and aſſaulting ſuch as came peaceably to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and doing Violence to the Meſſengers ſent from them, it is ſuch a <hi>Rapſodie</hi> of Stuff that no Man can credit upon his ſingle Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.

               <p>
                  <hi>OF the Nineteen Propoſitions,</hi> ſaith our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, <hi>he names none in particular, neither ſhall the Anſwer; but he inſiſts upon the old Plea, of his Conſcience, Honour and Reaſon;</hi> and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, to all honeſt Men, a perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Plea. This of the King's was a diſcourſe to himſelf, and therefore to what End ſhould he ſay more of them than what he does; <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q>If nothing elſe will ſatisfie, I muſt chuſe rather to be as Miſerable and Inglorious as my Enemies can make, or wiſh me.</q> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our Anſwerer, that knew them ſo well, ought firſt to have told us what they were, and then ſhewn the Unreaſonableneſs of the King's Refuſal: But, that he knew had been to Undeceive the People, and therefore ſlubber'd them under the General Name of the <hi>Nineteen Propoſitions;</hi> a Word of many Syllables Men have in their Mouths, but how few of them are there that know what it means? What therefore, he ſo maliciouſly ſuppreſs'd, I have with all Faithfulneſs ſumm'd, and made ſuch Remarks on them as followeth:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Lords,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Privy-Council, and all Great Officers of State be removed; ſave
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62942:46"/>only ſuch as ſhall be approv'd by Both Houſes; and none put in their Places, but by like Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Power hereby claimed, was either Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in the People, or it was not: If it was, they ought to have ſhown it; if it was not, the Demand was Unjuſt, and conſequently not to have been demanded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Great Affairs of the Kingdom, be Tranſacted only in Parliament; and Privy-Council Matters, by ſuch as ſhall be choſen by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And that no publick Act of Council be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med valid as proceeding from the Royal Authority, unleſs it be ſign'd by the major Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, nor vacant Place therein ſupply'd, without the Aſſent of the Major Part; and that alſo to be void, if not confirmed by the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was to ſet the Cipher before the Figure, and make the King a kind of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in <hi>Lucian;</hi> a Thing of a Swelling Name, but bound up to <hi>Fate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Lord High-Steward of</hi> England, <hi>Lord High-Conſtable, Lord Chancellor, Nine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Principal Officers, the Two Chief Juſtices, and Chief Baron, be always choſen with the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Both Houſes; and in the Intervals of Parliament, by the Major Part of the Council.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame may be ſaid to this, as to the Firſt; with this farther, that though the like had been often attempted, it never continued longer than the Rebellion that ſet it on foot.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That the Government of the King's Children be committed to ſuch as Both Houſes ſhall approve of; and in the Intervals of Parliament, by the Privy Council: And the Servants then about them,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62942:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt whom the Houſes have juſt Exception, to be removed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been to abridge the King of that Privilege, which the meaneſt of Subjects has in his Family; nor had themſelves yet try'd it in theirs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>That no Marriage for any of them be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or concluded without Conſent of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame alſo here, as to the Fourth.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>That the Law in Force againſt Jeſuits, Prieſts, and Popiſh Recuſants, be ſtrictly put is Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where had the King ever refuſed it?</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>That the Votes of Popiſh Lords in the Houſe of Peers, be taken away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been to take away their Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; a Right as ancient as any thing but the Monarchy it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>The the King will be pleaſed to reform the Church-Government, and Liturgy, as both Houſes ſhall adviſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This had been already ſettled by ſeveral Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>That he would reſt ſatisfied with what they have done, for ordering the</hi> Militia; <hi>and recall his Declarations and Proclamations againſt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This confeſſes an Uſurpation upon the King's Right, and in that, who began the War: For, if it were not ſo, what need was there for the King to recall his Declarations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when in doing it, he had made himſelf Guilty of the War, and all the Blood therein ſpill'd.</p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>That ſuch Members as have been put out of any Place or Office, ſince this Parliament began, be reſtored, or have Satisfaction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how does this agree with the <hi>Self-denying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62942:47"/> 11. <hi>That all Privy Counſellors and Judges take an Oath, to be ſettled by Act of Parliament, for the Maintenance of the Petition of Right, and certain Statutes made by them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Judges are <hi>ex Officio</hi> oblig'd to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of a General Act of Parliament, and ſuch the <hi>Petition of Right</hi> is; but who knew what thoſe Acts of this Parliament might be?</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>That all Judges and Officers plac'd by Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Houſes, may hold their Places</hi> quamdiu ſe bene geſſerint.</p>
               <p>To the intent, that if any Confiding Perſon how Ignorant or Factious ſoever had been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by them, it ſhould not be in the King's Power to remove him without a Sute at Law, in which themſelves, or their Creatures were ſure to be Judges.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>That all Delinquents, whether within the Kingdom, or fled out of it; and all Perſons cited by either Houſe, may appear and abide the Cenſure of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, all ſuch Perſons as upon an innate Honour, according to their Duty, and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 11th. of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. had ſtood firm and Loyal to the King, againſt their Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="14">14. <hi>That the General Pardon offered by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, be granted with ſuch Exceptions, as ſhall be adviſed by Both Houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, who knew what thoſe Exceptions might be? Saving this, that they intended them not to any of themſelves: A thing that carried Rancour and Venom in it, and which was his Majeſty's whole drift to take off.</p>
               <p n="15">15. <hi>That all Forts and Caſtles be put into ſuch Hands, as the King with Approbation of Both Houſes, ſhall appoint.</hi>

               <p> That is, to keep them in their own Hands as they were; when yet, the Undoubted Right was the King's, and the Grant of it had given away the Sovereignty. An old Trick (which together with the Three firſt Propoſitions) they borrow'd from <hi>Montfort</hi>'s Rebellion in <hi>Henry</hi> III.'s Time.</p>
               <p n="16">16. <hi>That the King's Extraordinary Guards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>The King is the only Supream Arbiter of Peace and War; and, what honourable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with any of them had he ever refus'd?</p>
               <p n="18">18. <hi>That his Majeſty be pleaſed by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to clear the Lord</hi> Kimbolton, <hi>and the Five Members.</hi>

               <p>If they were Guilty, why ſhould they be leſs brought to Tryal than were <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>Strafford?</hi> And, if they were Innocent, what need of an Act of Parliament to clear them?</p>

               </head>
               <p>IT is the Nature of Flies to be ever buzzing, and blowing upon any thing that is raw; and has been the only deſign of our Anſwerer throughout his whole Book, not to deliver Things as they truly were, but to rake toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old exploded Forgeries, that having dreſs'd up the King as like a Tyrant as he can, he may have the more to ſay in Defence of the <hi>Parricide.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is the Way of Witches, to foretell thoſe Storms, themſelves intend to move: Nor had the Contrivers of ours been wanting to that Part of it; but the Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi>'s Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye lay ſo cloſe for them, that nothing could be done, unleſs they firſt brought his Maſts by the Board: And having gotten that Point of him, and the Rebellion of <hi>Ireland</hi> falling cloſe upon it, they only make an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, and buzze the People, that it was done with the King's Privity (at leaſt) if not by his Commiſſion: Whereby to repreſent him to the World, as the more Inhumane and Barbarous.</p>
               <p>Nor is this our <hi>Accuſer</hi> leſs wanting to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate it over again, when he ſays, <hi>That it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imaginable, that the</hi> Iriſh <hi>guided by ſo many</hi> Italian <hi>Heads, ſhould have ſo far loſt the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62942:50"/>Reaſon and common Senſe, as not ſupported with other Strength than their own, to begin a War ſo deſperate and irreconcilable, againſt both</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland <hi>at once, without ſome Authority from</hi> England, <hi>or great Aſſiſtance promiſed them, and aſſurance which they had in private, that no remedy ſhould be apply'd againſt them.</hi> All which being merely conjectural, by the ſame Reaſon it may be true, by the ſame Reaſon alſo it may be falſe; without there were ſomewhat more than Words to evince the Truth of it. And ſo taking that for granted, which ſhould have been firſt proved, he audaciouſly Charges <hi>the King as the Prime Author of that Rebellion, though both here and elſewhere he denies it with many Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations, but no ſolid Evidence.</hi> And how ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid his on the other hand are, may be worth the viewing.</p>

               <p>AND here again our Anſwerer lays his Foundation to this Chapter upon what he has ſo often run off to before, and been by me (and I hope) fully anſwered: That <hi>the firſt Original and Inſtitution of Kings was by the Conſent and Suffrage of the People,</hi> and calls them <hi>the entruſted Servants of the Commonwealth;</hi> but (in his wonted way) ſays not a Word how they came by this Power of chooſing; <hi>i. e.</hi> whether it were given them by God, or they took it themſelves: If God gave it them, he ought (one would think) to have prov'd where, when and how; at leaſt, rendred it probable that there was once ſome ſuch thing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62942:51"/>done, though the Grant be loſt: And if they took it themſelves, it was Unjuſt in its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, and conſequently they had no more Right to chuſe their Kings, than Children have to chuſe their Fathers. And yet, from this falſe Poſition magiſterially determines, That <hi>Kings do no Acts of Grace and Bounty, but in diſcharge of their publick Duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Sum of the King's Diſcourſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is againſt ſettling Religion by violent Means; and yet never did thing more eagerly, than to molest and perſecute the Conſciences of moſt religious Men, and made a War, and lost all, rather than not uphold an</hi> Hierarchy <hi>of perſecuting Biſhops.</hi> That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are not to be forced, but to be reduced by force of Truth, aid of Time, and uſe of good Means of Inſtructions and Perſwaſions, was his Principle as well as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s: but (ſaith Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham</hi> concerning the Queen's proceedings in the like Caſes) <q>Cauſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, when they exceed their Bounds,<note place="margin">

               <p>But, <hi>He obtruded new Ceremonies upon the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, <hi>and a new Liturgy upon the</hi> Scots <hi>with his Sword.</hi> Saving the Reverence of the Thing, it is Indifferent whether a Man Preach with his Hat on, or hung upon a Pin; the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have one way, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> another: The
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62942:52"/>ſame alſo may be ſaid of Ceremonies; but how indifferent ſoever they are in themſelves, when they are once commanded, the indifferency ceaſes in the Law that enjoyns them. And for that other, of <hi>the Liturgy upon the Scots:</hi> the King obtruded it not on them, much leſs <hi>with his Sword,</hi> becauſe it was ſent them at their own Requeſt, as I have ſhown before. But, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting their <hi>Kirk</hi> liked it not, what had they to do with a Church that did?

                  <q>That whenſoever his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Honour and Intereſt ſhould be in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they would as one Man (obliged by the Laws of God and Man) apply themſelves to his Succour and Defence.</q>—And the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and others the Lords of that Kingdom had (by their Letter of 1. <hi>July</hi> 1643.) aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his Majeſty, That no Arms ſhould be raiſed, without his ſpecial Commiſſion. And after all this (and contrary to the Common tye of Nature) to run into open Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him! What may it mean? I'll tell ye.</p>
               <p>This Matter had been hatching ever ſince the Third of his Reign, and though the Chick ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd not till the Year 1637, yet it could run
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62942:52"/>about with the Shell upon its Head, and it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Friends in <hi>England</hi> to keep it alive, till it could feed it ſelf, and if it liked not one Barn-door take to another. The Metaphor is too viſible to need Application. There was a kind of a <hi>Kirk Party</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> that finding the King firm to his Principles, knew there was no better way to deal with him than by reducing him to Neceſſities, to the end that being forc'd to extraordinary means for Supply, he might diſguſt the People, and conſequently attract an <hi>Odium.</hi> But what's a Bow without a Bowman? The <hi>Scots</hi> and they made but one <hi>Kirk,</hi> Money was the Nerve that would keep them together, and what need many words among Friends. Nor were they long without the occaſion of ſhewing their Fidelity: The new Liturgy (as before) had been ſent to <hi>Edinburgh.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> preſently take the <hi>Alarm;</hi> are quieted again, but loſt nothing by it, and in return make the King all Proteſtations of future Loyalty.</p>
               <p>How comes it then you'll ſay, that it was not long after that they invaded <hi>England,</hi> and after that took Arms for the Parliament againſt the King? The Caſe is plain; the King had no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the Houſes had, or at leaſt knew where to get it: Nor will it be unworth any Man's while to ſee what that was.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>After an abuſive and ſtrange apprehenſion of Covenants, as if Men</hi> pawn'd their Souls <hi>to them with whom they Covenant, he digreſſes to plead for Biſhops,</hi> firſt <q>from the antiquity of their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions here ſince the firſt Plantation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in this Iſle; <hi>next</hi> from an univerſal Preſcription ſince the Apoſtles till this laſt Century.</q> 
                  <hi>But what</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>avails the moſt primitive Antiquity againſt the plain Senſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which if the laſt Century have beſt follow'd, ought in our Eſteem to be first.

               <p> Abuſive he ſaid! But wherein? For neither is it the way of his Majeſty's Pen, nor can any forc'd Interpretation bring the words to any thing like it. For if the Contrivers and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers of the ſolemn League and Covenant did not reciprocally pawn their Souls to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they call'd God as a Witneſs and Avenger of the Perfidy. When <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> made a Covenant between them, they ſet up a Pillar and a heap of Stones; <hi>And Laban ſaid to Jacob, Behold this Heap,</hi>

                  <hi>and behold this Pillar; be they a Witneſs betwixt me and thee, and the God of our Fathers judge betwixt us: And Jacob Swore by the Fear of his Father Iſaac.</hi> i. e. By that God whom <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Father fear'd; whereas <hi>Laban</hi> on the other hand was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And yet the Oath was Religious and bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for it was not the God of <hi>Nahor,</hi> or the Pillar and heap of Stones that made any thing in it, but the true God that was repreſented by it. Not that I ſay that the <hi>Covenant</hi> was Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or obligatory to any but the exacters of it, as I ſhall ſhew preſently; but to take notice of that Saying of our Anſwerer, <hi>As if Men</hi> pawn'd their Souls <hi>to them with whom they Covenant:</hi> Which in other words make this: As if any Man ſhould be ſo ridiculous as to believe the Houſes (who knew the <hi>Scots</hi> were afraid of being left in the lurch, and therefore would not come in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it) meant any thing more by it than to ſerve a turn. And truly ſo far he was in the right; for there is a great deal of difference between a Heart-Oath and a Lip-Oath; a Book-blowing as the <hi>Scots</hi> call it; and the <hi>Tragedian</hi> more expreſſively,

               <p> Nor have I ſooner got over one (if) than another lies in my way: <hi>The King</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>pleads for the Biſhops, from their Antiquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But what avails Antiquity againſt Scripture, which if the laſt Century have beſt follow'd, ought in our eſteem to be firſt.</hi> But if they have not beſt follow'd it, what then? And if he has not prov'd that they have ſo done, as he has not; I ſay he has ſaid nothing to the purpoſe: But the matter concerns Churchmen, and I leave it to them, with this for my ſelf: St. <hi>Paul</hi> left <hi>Titus</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi>

               <p>The next thing he takes notice of is, that His Majeſty ſays, <q>He is unſatisfied with many Paſſages in the Covenant (ſome referring to himſelf, with very dubious and dangerous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations) for binding Men by Oath and Covenant to the Reformation of Church Diſcipline and Government.</q> To which our Anſwerer ſays: <hi>Firſt, thoſe Limitations were not more dangerous to him, than he to our Liberty and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> and cunningly ſlips the Cart before the Horſe, for well he knew Religion was but the Pretence, whereas the deſign was under the name of Liberty to warrant Licentiouſneſs; and therefore it was but good Manners that the Hand-maid waited on the Miſtreſs. <hi>Next,

               <p>
                  <q>Nor was it (ſaith his Majeſty) leſs than ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to enjoyn Oaths where former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Legal Engagements bound Men ſufficiently to all neceſſary Duties.</q> 
                  <hi>But it was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Practice of all reforming Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:</hi> Iſrael <hi>were bound enough before by the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>to all neceſſary Duties, yet with</hi> Aſa <hi>their King entred into a new Covenant at the beginning of a Reformation,</hi> &amp;c. And as well might he have prov'd it out of the firſt Words of <hi>Geneſis, Is the Beginning:</hi> i. e. In the beginning of <hi>Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> the World was Created, and in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>Reformation</hi> the Covenant was produc'd. But to give it a direct Anſwer: This New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of which he ſpeaks, was not about Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Privileges, or diſputable Liberties in matters of State, nor any Conjectural Fancies in Point of Religion,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12.15.</note> but <q>to ſeek the God of their Fathers; in which alſo the King joyn'd with them; and it is ſaid of it, that God was found of them, and gave them reſt round about, which cannot be ſaid of ours:</q> And which may be further obſervable; of all the Covenants made by the <hi>Jews,</hi> there was no one of them ever Sworn againſt the Will of the Supream, or at leaſt Subordinate Rulers; not oppoſed, but rather countenanced by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream; and the matter of their Covenant was always enjoyn'd by God himſelf.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62942:56"/>
               <p> And whereas he further ſays, <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>after the Captivity, without Conſent demanded of that King who was their Maſter, took a Solemn Oath to walk in the Commandments of God.</hi> See how he ſlurs it upon the unwary People! <hi>That King,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Jews</hi> from the Captivity to the coming of our Saviour, had no Kings of their own, but were govern'd by Deputies and Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who had not Supream Authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as it pleas'd the <hi>Perſian Monarchs</hi> (and afterward <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Succeſſors) to aſſign them; and theſe were call'd Heads or Princes of the Captivity, of whom <hi>Zerobabel</hi> was the firſt; and upon the Reſtauration of the Captivity by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> came back again with them to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Judah;</hi> and with him, <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> as one of the chief of the Fathers: For in the third of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> ver. 16. he is call'd a Ruler, and in the fifth, verſe 14. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in the Land of <hi>Judah:</hi> With this <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi> it was that the Princes and the Prieſts made the Covenant our Anſwerer ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Nehem. <hi>10.1.</hi>

                  </note> and entred into an Oath to walk in God's Laws. And now what need was there to demand <hi>that King's (Artaxerxes)</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, when his Vicegerent joyn'd with them? In a matter too, which terminated in themſelves, and their own Worſhip, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of extirpating their Maſters, the <hi>Syrians</hi> or <hi>Babylonians.</hi> And when he calls it <hi>a Solemn Oath,</hi> what other is it than to wheedle the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into an eaſier ſwallow of it, and that the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant</hi> was juſt ſuch another?</p>

               <p>THere is a great deal of difference between Accuſations and Calumnies, the firſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to all Popular States, whereby to keep any one's growing too great for the reſt (as may be ſeen in the <hi>Athenian Oſtraciſm,</hi> or Baniſhment for ten Years, and the <hi>Syracuſian Petaliſm,</hi> for five Years;) but Calumnies were ever exploded, as the bane and deſtruction of Common Society: And if they are ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to Commonwealths, what muſt they be to Monarchy, which is never truly ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but by being at unity within it ſelf? And yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62942:57"/>ſuch were the Artifices of thoſe times, that they rais'd their <hi>Babel</hi> on no other Foundation; and what the effect of it was, we have all ſeen: however, it muſt not ſeem ſtrange that our Anſwerer, bred at the Feet of thoſe <hi>Gamaliels,</hi> ſhould all along Copy ſo exactly after the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal. But to paſs his railing, and come to his Matter, which is ſo looſe and thin that I was once going to throw it away; till I better conſider'd, that the beſt way to undeceive the People, was to undraw the Curtain and ſhew them how they had been deceiv'd; and if in the doing it they have not tack'd together all the ſhreds and parings of Policy, let any Man judge.</p>
               <p>What the Plot of the Play was, appears in their laſt Act; and that was, by the Murther of their Lawful Soveraign, to transform and new model an ancient Monarchy into a Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome of a Commonwealth. But many things were to be done by the way, and without the People it was impoſſible to effect it. They knew the People lov'd the King, but had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al taken a diſcontent at ſomewhat, but what that was not a Man of them could tell: Nor were they to learn of what importance the aſperſing a Prince is, to boil up that diſcontent to a height fit for a Rebellion. To have done this directly had been to betray themſelves: No, they firſt commend him for a good Prince, a King that would do any thing for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—But alas! — There are ſome about him.—The more's the pity.—However, God in his time can mend all: And yet—the leſs they ſpake of it the better; which was as much as if they had been bidden to tell no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but Folk of it.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:62942:58"/>

               <p>Nor was the matter yet come from Words to Blows, when his Majeſty had gratified them in moſt of thoſe Particulars; but now that they had gotten an Army, it is not what the King would grant, but what the Houſes will be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to accept. The King alſo begins to have an Army, which, becauſe it appear'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable than they imagin'd Loyalty without Money could have ever brought together, they take up another Artifice, and clamour it to the People, That the King made uſe of Papiſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them: That all might be at Peace if it were not for Evil Counſellors: And for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that their Intentions were the liberties of the Kingdom, as the King in this Chapter particularly takes notice of; and our Anſwerer in his wonted Scurrility runs off to other matter; yet e're he was aware confeſſes, <hi>The Sum is, they thought to regulate and limit his</hi> Negative Voice,

                  <hi>and ſhare with him in the</hi> Militia, which (in the Eighty fifth Page of his Book) he owns to have been <hi>wrung out of his Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet while they thus charge the King with making uſe of Papiſts againſt them, they ſtifle that Army of Sectaries themſelves brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. An Army ſo diverſified in Opinion, that had any one Regiment of them been to have entred the Ark, the Flood might have ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er come than <hi>Noah</hi> ſuited them into Pairs.

               <p>And then for <hi>his hearkning to Evil Counſellors, a thing ſo often charg'd upon him by the Parliament.</hi> But who were theſe Evil Counſellors during His Majeſty's Impriſonment, and when they lock'd him up ſo that no-body could come at him,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62942:59"/>and yet ſtill the ſame Man? But we are off the Scent: Themſelves were not thoſe Counſellors; and if they had been (perhaps) we had heard no more of it. The Lord <hi>Cottington</hi> was a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Delinquent, but had the Grace to know where his Delinquency lay: He gave up his Maſterſhip of the Court of <hi>Wards</hi> to a confiding Lord, and for that time <hi>Cantavit vacuus</hi>—The Beaſt <hi>Caſtor</hi> takes his Name a <hi>Caſtrando,</hi> and when the Hunters have gotten what they Hunted him for, they take off their Dogs.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, for what concerns their own ſo much boaſted Preſervation of the Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom, it may be much doubted whether they did ſo or not; but this I dare ſay, if they merited Heaven by it, it was by an <hi>Antiperiſtaſis;</hi> for how ſtrong ſoever they found the Bleſſing of <hi>Judah</hi> upon this Land, they brought it down to that other of <hi>Iſſachar.</hi> As (beſides what I have ſaid before) witneſs their Committees (in every County under their Power) for the ſeizing and impriſoning Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>i. e.</hi> Such as refuſed to give them the 25th part of their Eſtates; and becauſe the County Gaols were too few to hold them, erecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in moſt Cities, and throwing the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable of them on Ship-board. — Their Sequeſtring the Eſtates of the Royal Party, and denying them the benefit of the Statute that indempnified them:<note place="margin">11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. c. 1.</note> Forcing ſome to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, and ſelling the Eſtates of ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it.—Their frequent Headings and Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettings.—Their Sale of King's, Queen's, Princes, Church-Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <q>IT is no News (ſaith his Majeſty) to have all Innovations uſher'd in with the name of Reformations in Church and State, by thoſe, who, ſeeking to gain Reputation with the Vulgar for their extraordinary Parts or Piety, muſt needs undo whatever was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſettled never ſo well and wiſely.</q> And <hi>leſs News it is</hi> (ſaith our Anſwerer) <hi>to have all Reformation cenſur'd and oppos'd under the name of Innovation, by thoſe, who being exalted in high Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces above their Merit, fear all change, though of things never ſo ill, or ſo unwiſely ſettled.</hi> Which is no more than ſo many Words ſtitch'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without he had ſhewn wherein this Book had been ſo ill or unwiſely ſettled: But were there—That had been to queſtion the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Wiſdom of the Compilers of it, whom Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> calls Martyrs; or what was worſe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>and</hi> 3 Ed. 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1.</note> run foul of the Statute that ſays, It was concluded by the aid of the Holy-Ghoſt.</p>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62942:60"/>that it is for the better. But the point lies elſewhere.

                  <q>I look upon Treaties (ſaith his Majeſty) as a retiring from Fighting like Beaſts, to argue like Men. — And though I could ſeldom get the Opportunity, I never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either deſire or diſpoſition to it.</q> And <hi>if</hi> (ſays our Anſwerer) <hi>he look'd upon Treaties as a retiring from Beſtial Force to Humane Reaſon, his firſt</hi> Aphoriſm <hi>here is in part deceiv'd, for Men may treat like Beaſts as well as fight. When through dilatory purpoſes they come from fighting to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining.</hi> Thereby inſinuating that ſuch and no other was the end of all the King's Treaties: But whoſe that degenerous way was, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King's or the Houſes we come to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; with this by the way, that the Houſes never deſir'd any Treaty, but when they were making their Recruits, or foreſaw the King would be upon them before they were ready for him, if they could not divert him by a Treaty: And ſuch was this their <hi>Petition to him at</hi> Colebrook <hi>to vouchſafe a Treaty.</hi> The Story lies thus.</p>
               <p>The King had ſet up his Standard at <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham,</hi> at which time <hi>Eſſex</hi> lay with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at <hi>Worceſter</hi> to attend his Motion, who finding his Forces not ſufficient enough to give <hi>Eſſex</hi> Battle, he went to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:62942:63"/>was quickly furniſh'd; and having appointed the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> to be General, marches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>London: Eſſex</hi> ſeems to take no notice of it, and makes no offer to ſtop him, but as ſoon as he was gone by keeps cloſe in his Rere: The King to avoid being hemm'd in between <hi>Eſſex</hi> and the City of <hi>London,</hi> turn'd upon him, and gave him Battle at <hi>Edgehill,</hi> in which, whoever had the better of it, <hi>Eſſex</hi> thought fit to get back for <hi>London,</hi> which was ſo frighted that they had ſhut up their Shops, and the Houſes cauſed all the Train'd-Bands and Auxiliaries to be drawn together. The King on the other hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſtruck off to <hi>Oxford,</hi> but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his former Reſolves for <hi>London,</hi> he again advances towards it, and is met (with the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition before-mention'd) at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it nothing but a deſign to get time, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his way at <hi>Branford,</hi> where he cut off three of their Regiments, and (by what Fate or Council I know not) was again diverted for <hi>Oxford;</hi> whither (the <hi>North</hi> being generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to his Obedience) the Queen return'd from <hi>Holland.</hi> His Arms ſucceſsful in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> their own affairs half under Water, and they <hi>Scots</hi> not yet come to their Aſſiſtance, they ſend Commiſſioners to Treat, but with ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions as they were ſure would protract time, but never be yielded unto.</p>
               <p>And if he will not, <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> had two Armies, and they appear before <hi>Oxford,</hi> but the deſign having been ſmelt before, the Queen is ſent into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and himſelf march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Worceſter,</hi> on which <hi>Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> divide their Armies, <hi>Eſſex</hi> goes into the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>Waller</hi> follows the King, who turn'd

               <p>This Treaty is the Argument of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and though I have been longer in coming to it than might regularly become the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Reply, yet becauſe it contributes much to the diſcovery of the Intrigue, and where the fault lay, and whether the King or the Houſes may be charg'd more juſtly with it, I may be the more excuſeable.</p>

               <p> To be ſhort, the Treaty began, and the King made ſuch large Conceſſions, that if they had met him one third of the way,<note place="margin">See the Treaty at large in the Folio Book of the King's Works. Ecl. <hi>512</hi>
                  </note> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but it muſt have concluded in a Peace. For it was (as alſo ſays our Anſwerer) come to theſe three Heads; <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> the <hi>Militia,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> To which His Majeſty's Commiſſioners thus anſwer'd, That the firſt as it was propos'd took off all dependency of the Clergy upon His Majeſty, propoſing only the Biſhops Lands to be ſettled on him (ſubject nevertheleſs to the diſpoſal of the Houſes) whereas all the Lands of Biſhops, Deans and Chapters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (if thoſe Corporations muſt be diſſolv'd) belong to the King in his own Right.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Militia,</hi> as it was propoſed, the King was ſo totally diveſted of the Regal Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Sword, that he would be no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend any of his Allies than his own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions from Rebellion and Invaſion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the whole Power of Peace and War (the acknowledg'd and undoubted Right of the Crown) is taken from him.</p>
               <p>And as to <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Power of nominating the Lord Lieutenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Officers there, and in that the dependency of that Kingdom, would as it was propos'd, be taken from him. And to add to all, it was farther propos'd, to bereave him of the Power of a Father in the Education and Marriage of his Children, and of a Maſter in rewarding his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. And ſo, what between pretended want of Inſtructions, and the twenty days ſpun out to nothing, the Treaty broke off, as well it might, with them that came prepar'd not to yield any thing: However, his Majeſty's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:62942:65"/>deſir'd an Enlargement of time, but it would not be granted.</p>
               <p>And to Salve it on their ſide, our Anſwerer runs to his common Topick, <hi>That the King had</hi> nothing (no <hi>not ſo much as Honour</hi>) <hi>but of the People's Gift, yet talks on equal terms with the grand Repreſentative of that People, for whoſe ſake he was made King:</hi> And is one of the modeſteſt Expreſſions of his whole Book, and which I have ſo fully anſwer'd before, <label type="milestone">

               <p>Nor has our <hi>Accuſer</hi>'s railing given me Ground to take notice of him in this Chapter, other than when he ſays, <hi>His Lips acquitted the Parliament not long before his Death of all the Blood ſpilt in this War;</hi> which alſo he had ſaid before; and to what I then urg'd I only add this now, That His Majeſty at the Treaty of the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> ſeeing the unreaſonableneſs of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, made ſome <hi>Queries</hi> upon them, of which this was one,<note place="margin">See tho King's Book in Folio.

His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty came as near the Wind as with Honour he could, till finding at laſt that nothing would do, as ſtripp'd as he was of every thing but his Vertue, and the Freedom of his Mind, he juſtified to the World, that however he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the common Chance, he was not under the Dominion of Fortune.</p>

That the <hi>Scots</hi> firſt began his Troubles, and the Houſes improv'd upon it, has been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhown: And yet ſo deſirous was the King of Peace, that after ſo many fruitleſs Meſſages, he again (in the Winter 1645.) ſent to the Houſes for a paſs for the Duke of <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and others, to bring them New Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which was denied him a firſt and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time: Then he ſent to them that himſelf might come in Perſon, which was as often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him, as being the only thing they now fear'd from him; and therefore, inſtead of granting it, they made an Ordinance, <q>That the Commanders of the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in Caſe the King ſhould attempt to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Line of Communication, ſhould raiſe
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62942:68"/>what Forces they thought fit to ſuppreſs Tumults, to apprehend ſuch as came with him, and to ſecure (<hi>i. e.</hi> to Impriſon) his Perſon from Danger.</q> And our Anſwerer confeſſes it to have been ſaid, That <hi>His purpoſe was to have come to</hi> London, <hi>till hearing how ſtrictly it was Proclaimed, that no Man ſhould conceal him, he diverted his Courſe.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>What Prudence</hi> (ſaith our Anſwerer) <hi>there could be in it, no Man can imagine: Malice there might be, by raiſing new Jealouſies to divide Friends.</hi> And excellent Friends, no doubt but he thought them, by the Character he gives them; <hi>As hireling Army of</hi> Scots, <hi>paid for their Service here, not in</hi> Scotch <hi>Coin, but in</hi> Engliſh <hi>Silver; nay, who from the firſt beginning of theſe Troubles, what with Brotherly Aſſiſtance, and what with Monthly Pay, have defended their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Conſciences at our Charge.</hi> And ſo concludes it <hi>hazardous</hi> and <hi>raſh.</hi> What the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of it might have been is too late to enquire now, but that it was not Raſh but Prudent, will readily appear, if we conſider,</p>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:62942:69"/>he manages it! Nor are his Brethren leſs than beholding to him. <hi>That the</hi> Scots <hi>in</hi> England <hi>ſhould</hi> ſell their King, <hi>as the King here affirms, and</hi> for a Price ſo much above that, <hi>which the Covetouſneſs of</hi> Judas <hi>was contented with to ſell</hi> our Saviour, <hi>is ſo foul an Infamy and Diſhonour caſt upon them, as befits none to vindicate but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And it were but friendly Counſel to wiſh them beware the Son, who comes among them with a firm belief that they Sold his Father.</hi> In the former Chapter he gibes them with their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Aſſiſtance; and here, to whet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Son of that Father, he lays at their Door an Infamy ſo foul, that if they do not Vindicate it themſelves, no one elſe (he is ſure) can do it for them: And why all this, but to tell them in other Words <hi>(Scelere ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landum eſt Scelus)</hi> they had gone too far, not to go farther, and therefore cannot be ſecure till they do as much by his Son.</p>
               <p>Whatever it be (I think) this may be ſaid in the Matter, That as Truſt is the Sinew of Society, Truth is the Pledge of it: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as they were his Majeſty's Countrymen, and Sworn Subjects, in Confidence of which he had intruſted his Perſon with them; as the keeping that Oath impeded no moral Good (a diſtinction yet which every Man will not allow;) as the Perſon to whom they ſwore, was not incapable of an Oath (which is much the ſame;) as he came not to incline them to any thing but that Duty which was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon them; and if he had no voluntary Rule in their Hearts, he wanted Power to gain a Coerſive — If they had not thought fit to defend him, they ſhould not have put him in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62942:70"/>a worſe Condition than they found him. He was their King, and wanted no Letters of Safe-Conduct; and therefore, as he came free, they ought to have ſet him as free out of his Enemies reach.<note place="margin">2 Kings 16.22.</note> 
                  <q>Thou ſhalt not ſmite them, (ſaid <hi>Eliſha</hi> to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Syrians</hi> he had then in his Power) for thou neither tookeſt them with thy Sword nor thy Bow: But ſet Bread and Water before them, that they may eat and drink, and let them go.</q> And the kindneſs prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> though had the Caſe here been, that they had taken him, I know not how they could have deliver'd him up. And memorable to this Purpoſe is that of <hi>James</hi> the Fourth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who when <hi>Perkin Warbeck</hi> had fled to him for Protection, from our <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected him, but rais'd an Army for him; him, with whoſe Head he might have made what Peace he would with King <hi>Henry</hi> his profeſt Enemy: And when at laſt a Peace was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between the Kings (upon the Marriage of King <hi>James</hi> with <hi>Margaret,</hi> Eldeſt Daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, by whoſe Iſſue came the Union of the Crowns) he not only refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliver up the ſaid <hi>Perkin,</hi> but gave him a ſafe Tranſport for himſelf and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
               <p>There remains yet to have ſpoken to that other part of the Title of this Chapter, <hi>His Captivity at</hi> Holdenby; but becauſe our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer takes no notice of it, neither (I think) ought I.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>THIS ſurprize of me (ſaith his Majeſty) tells the World, that a <hi>KING</hi> cannot be ſo low, but he is conſiderable, adding weight to that Party where he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. — What the Presbyterians have hunted after, the Independants now ſeek to catch for themſelves—And as an Argument that they are manumitted from the Rivals Service, aſſume my Perſon into the Armies Cuſtody, without any Commiſſion, but that of their own Will and Power.</q> To which our Anſwerer. <hi>To give an Account to Royaliſts what has been done with their Vanquiſh'd King's yielded up into our</hi> (i. e. the Peoples) <hi>Hands, is not to be expected from them whom God hath made Conquerors. And, for Brethren to debate, and rip up their falling out in the Ear of a Common Enemy, is neither wiſe nor comely. To the King therefore, were he living, or to his Party yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, as to this, belongs no Anſwer.</hi> No! and why not? Becauſe thoſe that had a Mind to be ſatisfied in the Action, might deſire to know by what juſt Means the King came into their Hands? How Subjects, whom the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62942:72"/>never call'd Enemies, could be ſaid to have conquer'd him? How God came intituled to it, when it was ſo directly contrary to the Law of God? And how the Law of the Land, which was their common Cry to defend, could juſtifie that Rebellion and Parricide, which it every where condemns? And is it enough (think ye) to ſay no Anſwer belongs to it? He knew there was none to be given, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Magiſterially ſlighted it. He holds it alſo <hi>neither wiſe nor comely, that the falling out of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren be debated before a Common Enemy;</hi> and tacitly implies his Reaſon, leaſt the Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed rejoice. But (I think) I can tell ye a better. When Presbytery rode the fore-Horſe, no one kept up with it more than himſelf; but, when he found it began to faulter, he was loth to loſe Company, and jogg'd on with the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt leading Men that carried on the War were <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> and their General upon the New-Model was as right as they could wiſh to have had him: And yet, he was in the Hands of the Army, and that Army in the Hands of his Lieutenant-General <hi>Cromwell:</hi> A grand miſtake of theirs, in thinking to Settle. Presbytery with an Army of <hi>Anabaptiſts, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, Fifth-Monarchy-Men,</hi> and what not: Bone of their Bone, and Fleſh of their Fleſh ('tis true) but as Mortal Enemies to them, as were the <hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and yet both of them had <hi>Abraham</hi> to their Father: And for <hi>Cromwell,</hi> though no one could ſay of what Religion he was (beſides that he ever match'd the Colour that was in Faſhion) he ſtill proteſted Obedience and Fidelity to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62942:72"/>and by that Means got his Ends of the King and them.</p>
               <p>And whether our Anſwerer took it not right, judge, when he ſays, <hi>Some of the former Army, touch'd with Envy to be out-done by a New Model; and being prevalent in the Houſe of Commons, took advantage of</hi> Presbyterian <hi>and</hi> Independant <hi>Names, and the War being ended, thought ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have diſcarded them, without their due Pay, and the reward of their invincible Valour. But they</hi> (i. e. the Independants) <hi>who had the Sword yet in their hands, diſdaining to be made the firſt Objects of Ingratitude and Oppreſſion, after all that Expence of their Blood for Juſtice and the Common Liberty, ſeiz'd the King, their Priſoner; whom nothing but their match<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And truly, when they that once had it could not keep it, what had our Anſwerer to do to gape after them any longer: And brings into my Head that Story of the <hi>Friars, Crucifixus eſt etiam pro nobis.</hi> But to go on with the Matter.</p>
               <p>The King is now in the Army's Hands, but our Anſwerer thinks not fit to ſay a Word to <q>the Diſtractions in the Two Houſes, the Army, and the City, that enſued it,</q> but has left it out of his Title: And why, but that it muſt not be ſpoken in <hi>Gath,</hi> when yet every Man here is not a Dweller of <hi>Askalon.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Cromwell</hi> found that the Parliament out-card<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, as having gotten the King their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,<note place="margin">May 4, 1646.</note> and put the <hi>Militia</hi> of <hi>London</hi> into the Hands of a Committee of Citizens, whereof the Lord Mayor for the time being to be One;

To this purpoſe he and <hi>Ireton</hi> (his Son-in-Law) take advantage of a Vote of theirs (25. <hi>May</hi> 1647.) for Disbanding the whole Army, excepting Five Thouſand Horſe, and One Thouſand Dragoons, and ſome Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, to be kept up for the Safety of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſome to be ſent for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſpread a Whiſper through the Army, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, now they had the King, intended to Disband them, to cheat them of their Arrears, and ſend them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be deſtroy'd by the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it ran like Wild-fire; for, the Army were ſo inrag'd at it, that they ſet up a new Council among themſelves of Two Private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers out of every Troop and Foot Company, to conſult for the Good of the Army, and to aſſiſt at the Council of War, and adviſe for the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom: And theſe they called <hi>Agitators</hi> or <hi>Adjutators,</hi> it matters not which; for whatever <hi>Cromwell</hi> (who yet ſtood unſuſpected by the Houſes) had a mind to be done, there needed no more but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it into theſe Agitators Heads. And the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of their firſt Conſultation was to take the King from <hi>Holmby</hi> (where, upon his being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd up by the <hi>Scots,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Feb. 16. 1646.</note> the Parliament had lodged him with Colonel <hi>Graves</hi>) and bring him to the Army.</p>
               <p>Amongſt theſe there was one <hi>Joyce,</hi> a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, bold, ignorant, <hi>Enthuſiaſtick</hi> Journey-man Taylor, who from the Service of <hi>Denys Bond</hi> had gone out to the Aſſiſtance of the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62942:73"/>the Mighty, and much about this time made a Cornet of Horſe: And however the matter was contriv'd (for Commiſſion he had none) he went off by Night in the Head of a Thouſand Horſe, and having ſurpriz'd the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Guards at <hi>Holmby,</hi> early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, importunately demands admittance into the King's Bed-Chamber, as from the Army, and was hardly prevail'd upon, to ſtay ſo long as till the King could get up; but being come in, told his Majeſty he was ſent by the Lieutenant-General, to ſecure his Perſon from his Enemies, and bring him to the Army: On which, the King demanding to ſee his Commiſſion, <hi>Joyce</hi> opens a Window, and points to the Body of Horſe that ſtood drawn up on the Side of the Hill before the Houſe; An undeniable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſays his Majeſty, and ſo went with him; who brought him to the Head-quarters at <hi>New-Market. Cromwell</hi> ſeems no leſs ſurpriz'd at it than the King; however ſince he was among them, aſſur'd him, he ſhould have no Cauſe to repent it; and in a ſeeming paſſionate Manner promis'd him, to reſtore him to his Right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Parliament.</p>
               <p>On this the Parliament ſend to the General, to have the King redeliver'd to their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners; and this the rather, for that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral by his Letters to them, had excus'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and the Body of the Army as ignorant of the Fact; and that the King came away willingly with thoſe Souldiers, that brought him. And yet, inſtead of giving them an Anſwer,<note place="margin">Jun. 23. 1647.</note> the Army ſend a Charge againſt Eleven of their Members, all active leading Men, and require them to appoint a Day to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this Parliament, and in the mean time to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62942:74"/>ſuſpend the Eleven Members ſitting in the Houſe; to which laſt they only anſwer, and ſay, they could not do it by Law, till the Particulars of the Charge were produced; and were ſoon replied to with their own Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>London Militia</hi> had been yet in the Cities Hands, till <hi>Cromwell</hi> taking the opportunity of a thin Houſe,<note place="margin">Jul. 26. 1647.</note> procures the Ordinance of the Fourth of <hi>May</hi> aforeſaid to be revok'd, and the <hi>Militia</hi> put into other Hands, more favourable to the Army. On which a Rabble of Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices and Disbanded Soldiers, headed by the Sheriffs, under the Name of a Petition, beſet the Houſes, and force them to reſettle it as it had been on the Citizens.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the two Speakers, with forty of the Lower Houſe, five Earls, one Viſcount and three Lords, run off to the Army, and Vote with them in their Council of War in the Nature of a Parliament, and engage to live and die with the Army.</p>
               <p>And <hi>a Mercy it was,</hi> ſays our Anſwerer, <hi>that they had a Noble and Victorious Army ſo near at hand to fly to!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The remains of the Houſes on the other hand chuſe new Speakers, and raiſe an Army in the City; and declare in Print, it was in Order to his Majeſty's being free, and in a capacity of treating: which yet they made uſe of but as a Stale to the Faction.</p>
               <p>The Army-Soldiers alſo engage to <hi>Fair fax,</hi> that they will live and die with him; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (<hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch of the Houſes as had fled to them) and the Army, who ſet out a Declaration of the Grounds of their march towards <hi>London,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:62942:74"/>and denying them to have been a Parliament, ſince the ſaid 26 of <hi>July,</hi> at what time they were under a force, call them the <hi>Gentlemen at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi> and by a Letter to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen, reproach them with thoſe Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and demand the City to be delivered into their Hands, to which purpoſe they were now coming to them.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the Forces the City had raiſed were able, and willing enough to have fought the Army; but the Lord Mayor and Court of Aldermens Hearts failing them, they open their Gates, and let them march through the City.</p>
               <p>And now the firſt thing was to replace the Speakers, and purge the Houſes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1647.</note> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accordingly done, and a holy Thankſgiving appointed, they declare all that had paſt in the Houſes from the ſaid 26 of <hi>July,</hi> to the 6 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to be null and void. And the Army (in their way) impeach ſome, impriſon others, demoliſh the Line of Communication, and take every thing into their own Hands. And yet to ſweeten the People on the other ſide, they treat the King (now at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi>) with more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Reſpect than had been ſhewn him by the Parliament's Commiſſioners; for they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allow him his own Chaplains, and permit his Children and ſome Friends to ſee him, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to eſtabliſh him in his juſt Rights; to call Committees and Sequeſtrators to an account, and free the People from Exciſe and Taxes; and now who but the Army and <hi>Cromwell!</hi>

               <p>Such (as well as I could put them together) were the Diſtractions in the two Houſes, the Army and the City, that enſued the Army's ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſal of the King at <hi>Holmby.</hi> And here they

               <p>HIS Majeſty's Father, King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, who might have truly ſaid, Many and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil have been the days of my Pilgrimage, thought it not enough to have paſs'd thoſe Windings himſelf without leaving his Son ſome Clue to direct him; and therefore wrote that his <gap reason="foreign">

For as to himſelf, it is ſo <hi>ad fidem Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriae,</hi> and as to the Prince ſo <hi>ad exemplar juſti Imperii,</hi> that whoever he be that opens it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudice, cannot (to uſe his Majeſty's Words) <q>meaſure his Cauſe by the Succeſs, nor his Judgment of things by his Misfortunes.</q> And truly when I came to this Letter I was thinking to my ſelf what our <hi>Accuſer</hi> could ſay to it, till having peruſed his Anſwer I was thus far ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that he deceiv'd not my Expectation; for inſtead of giving it any ſolid Anſwer he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly catches at Words, <hi>Et minutiis, rerum pondera frangit:</hi> And had he gone no farther, how blamable ſoever he might have been, he had been leſs Ignominious: But when he rakes thoſe

               <p>In ſhort, this Letter might have ſhewn him if he had pleas'd, how <q>when ſome Mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſe them for Sedition and Faction they ſtop its Mouth with the name and noiſe of Religion; and when Piety pleads for Peace and Patience, they cry out Zeal.</q> When on the contrary all good Men know that this is a Religion not proceeding from the Spirit, but a Worm of their own breeding, how devoutly <hi>(i. e.

And what the ſad Effects of this has been we cannot (ſure) have ſo ſoon forgotten: When God was brought in to the worſt of Actions; the King abus'd in the affections of his People; Religion wounded with a Feather of its own; and the State fired with a Coal from the Altar.</p>

Or if he were, the Army was in his Hands, the Parliament in his Pocket, the City at his Feet, and which of them was there durſt firſt ſay to him, What art thou doing?</p>
               <p>There ſtood nothing now in his way but the King; he had no more need of him, and how ſhould he diſpoſe of him? To keep him in the Army was troubleſome; to let the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans get him had been a Bar to his deſign; and to have murthered him had nothing further'd it, for as yet he was but Lieutenant General: The beſt way therefore was to let him eſcape beyond Sea: To which purpoſe private Letters are ſlipp'd into his Hand, that the Agitators had a deſign upon his Life, which coming alſo to his Ear from report, and the Guards purpoſely diſpoſed for it, the King in a dark rainy Night makes his eſcape from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> but the Veſſel that ſhould have carried him over ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he unfortunately fell into the Hands of Colonel <hi>Hammond,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> who ſecures him in <hi>Carisbrook-Caſtle,</hi> and ſends to the Parliament to know their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure concerning him.</p>
               <p>From thence His Majeſty ſends to the Houſes his deſires for a Perſonal Treaty,<note place="margin">

               <p>But the King refuſing to grant them, the Parliament Vote there ſhould be no more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes made him: And upon <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s laying his Hand upon his Sword and telling them the People expected their Safety from them, and not from a Man whoſe Heart God had hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the Vote of <hi>Non-Addreſſes</hi> was made into an Ordinance, and that it ſhould be High-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to receive any Meſſage from him.</p>
               <p>And now Compaſſion for the King's Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, with the diſcovery of their Hypocriſie, had begotten ſuch a general Indignation againſt the Parliament, that all <hi>Wales</hi> declare for the King: The <hi>Surrey</hi> Men Petition the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a Perſonal Treaty; the ſame was <hi>Kent</hi> coming up to have done, but ſeeing how evilly thoſe of <hi>Surrey</hi> had been Treated, they threw away their Petition and took Arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Earl of <hi>Norwich.</hi> The ſame did others at <hi>Maidſtone, Black-heath, Kingſtone,</hi> &amp;c.

And admitting it, I never heard that any of thoſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ever perſwaded the People that it was lawful to Murther thoſe Kings; or how does it make out this his <hi>Iuſtice</hi> againſt the King? 'Tis a ſhrewd ſign a Man is ſinking when he takes hold of Twigs.</p>
